<h3>PLN Training March</h3>
 Indonesia Energy Access Scale Up Project
Training for PLN Staff in a GIS-based Energy Planning approach
Prepared March 26, 2014

Summary:  The Earth Institute’s (EI) electricity planning work in Eastern Indonesia (Maluku, Maluku Utara and NTT) employed several techniques using national and PLN datasets via spreadsheets and data-manipulation programs, open-source and freely available GIS software as well as the EI’s web-tool <networkplanner.org>.  The WorldBank consultants, EI and Castalia, working on the Indonesia Energy Access Scale up Project will present final results in Jakarta on Wednesday, March 26.  Following this workshop, the EI team will offer trainings on the methodology and datasets used to derive such plans.  
We propose here a two-day intensive training to provide additional interactive exercises and insights into the methods employed by EI for the analysis.  The intent is to share ways of organizing data and presenting it to other departments within and outside the trainees’ agency.  The team intends for the training to immediately follow the March 26 workshop in two parts.  
•	Part 1: Directed to PLN Pusat planners and Engineering Services department to understand (i) the development of a GIS layered database of demographics and (ii) subsequent proposed electrification plans, and the process for deriving and re-creating them. 
•	Part 2: Directed to PLN Wilayah staff and planning practitioners, Business and Technical Planning, to understand electrification plans and "adjust" the plan data and perform calculations on that data consistent with their RoadMap requirements to complement budgetary requests.  

It is highly recommended that PLN selects staff members for this training who have some familiarity or training with GIS tools (e.g. MapInfo, Google Earth, QGIS, JOSM or similar).  They will be best prepared to establish and maintain a geospatial dataset.  Each participant should bring a laptop with admin permissions in order to participate in training exercises.

•	Laptops / desktops
Overview:
The Earth Institute (EI) developed a digital, geo-spatially referenced demographic and MV line dataset as an input into its electricity planning model.  The objective of this proposal is for EI to work with a core team of planners to provide a) sufficient technical support, in a local context, working side-by-side with PLN staff from both NTT and Ambon Wilayah offices and for the development of their annual Roadmaps plans and b) to provide an understanding of the proposed electrification plans, and the process for deriving, adjusting and re-creating them.  This capacity building component biases on use of open-source software tools widely used for validation and editing of newly-acquired map data.  
We recommend the following staff and resources for this training:
1)	E.I. will provide: 
a.	3-4 researchers from the NYC team, for the workshop and subsequent two-day intensive training.
b.	Copies of free, open-source software for data collection, editing and analysis
2)	PLN is to provide:
a.	A meeting room to accommodate all trainees with a projector.  Laptops/Desktops should be available for all participants as well as an internet connection as portions of the material are web based. 
b.	12-16 managerial, planning and technical-level PLN staff:  6-8 from the NTT Wilayah and Kupang Area offices, and another 6-8 from the Ambon Wilayah and/or Area offices, all committed for the full week visit.
3)	BPS and BIG are invited to attend training modules of interest to them, particularly with reference to forming a GIS demographic dataset. 
Proposed Outline:
In the interest of covering the breadth of analysis tools used within a short period of time, we are proposing condensing all major processes employed in the geospatial analysis into distinct modules. Each module will be designed to span about 1 hour and will encourage trainees to follow along to produce an exemplative output of a smaller subset of the project area.  It will be impossible to train in depth on all the skills used but we thought it was best to touch upon all aspects used at least a little bit.  Below are key topic to be covered in through the training modules:  
 
Day 1
1.	Introduction
2.	Forming a GIS demographic dataset of NTT & MMU.
3.	Digitizing PLN Assets to form a consolidated, shareable dataset of the MV Network
4.	Using NetworkPlanner to envision an optimal planning-level proposed network
5.	Exporting, Understanding and visualizing NetworkPlanner results

Day 2
6.	Sequencing a Connections on a Grid Rollout 
7.	Summarizing the Plan, Evaluating Per Household Costs, Developing Phases and resulting Budget envelopes
8.	Understanding the PLN Roadmap Formulation
9.	Re-evaluate Updated Electrification Scenarios
10.	Useful Calculations in QGIS for Roadmap Process
11.	Exercise: Substantiating a Budget Request with a Geospatial Plan

Day 3 (tentative, given trainee interest)
12.	Time Reserved for Additional Interests 

Below is a suggested use of the two-day allotment to cover modules that in parts are mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive of the process.

Thursday, 27 March 2014
1	9:00 AM	Introduction, Software Installation, Distributing Data 	The EI team will begin the training session by reviewing what will and will not be covered throughout the two days, helping trainees install any necessary software and will distribute the associated data for the day’s exercises and the analysis as a whole.  	General Discussion
 2	9:30 AM	Forming a GIS demographic dataset of NTT & MMU.	The EI team incorporated the best available national datasets provided courtesy of BIG and BPS to form a comprehensive, collectively exhaustive geo-referenced demographic dataset of project area in the Malukus and NTT.  Here we will review (i) the merger of BPS & BIG data and sub-Desa level classification used and (ii) the use of BPS Desa level data in the absence of any settlement land use classification.  In this way, one composite view of Demographics was established quickly albeit coarsely. 	QGIS
3	10:30 AM	Digitizing PLN Assets to form a consolidated, shareable dataset	In MMU and NTT, PLN has an excellent institutional knowledge of locations, types and quantity of MV line assets but in a bit of distributed, disaggregated form.  To better serve Pusat and Wilayah level planning, the EI team formed a central repository <plngridmaps.modilabs.org> to edit, collaborate and host geo-located PLN assets essential for planning. Here we review the process involved in this development and ability to edit, add and continue collaborating via this resource.   	JOSM + plngridmaps
	11:30 AM	Lunch/Prayer Break		
3 	12:30 PM	Using NetworkPlanner to envision an optimal planning-level future network	The Earth Institute developed an open source software called NetworkPlanner that uses geospatially referenced data to create a long-term least cost electrification plan.  Here we explain the three electrification options evaluated in our methodology and essential inputs used. The intention is to use NetworkPlanner as a way to substantiate investment focuses in high-need areas.  Note the difference between NetworkPlanner long-term planning vs near term 1-3 year plans.	network-planner
5	1:30 PM	Exporting, Understanding and visualizing NetworkPlanner results 	Groups of trainnees will be asked to model variations of electrification scenarios in Sula given various assumptions for growth rate, service standard, etc. 	network-planner



Friday, 28 March 2014
6	9:00 AM	Sequencing a Grid Rollout	Given an optimal network, it becomes of interest to sequence the build-out of such a network to develop Phases and Investment Tranches.  Here we review a methodology for interpreting the proposed network to sequence all the grid-proposed settlements.	R
7	10:00 AM	Summarizing the Plan, Evaluating Per Household Costs, Developing Phases and resulting Budget envelopes	Given a settlement ranked network, here we review methods to develop Phase bins to match the RUPTL and the expected CAPEX and OPEX costs associated with each phase to ultimately help budgets and required subsidies for regions of interest.  	Excel
 	11:00 AM	Break	 	 
8	11:15 AM	Roadmap Formulation	Understanding Roadmap requirements, current uses of GIS. 	discussion
 	12:30 PM	Lunch	 	 
9	1:30 PM	Re-evaluate Updated Electrification Scenarios	Given the updated demographic and existing network files determined in the morning, the team will review a subset area within MMU/NTT and resummarize key outputs of the single scenario.  Participants will be encouraged to follow along. 	QGIS + Excel
10	2:30 PM	Useful Calculations in QGIS for Roadmap Process	In the PLN Roadmap process, it's helpful to understand metrics about village locations with regards to existing PLN assets and target goals.  Here we cover functionality in the free, well supported GIS package QGIS.  Functions we will cover include how to:
- Data correction, trimming extraneous segments, etc
- Sum proposed grid linelength
- Sum the demand to get peak loads per region 
- Aggregate by sub-network and admin unit and/or island group
- Aggregate all of the above by phase
- Subsetting out mini-grids and Re-calculating mini-grid costs with lower demand/generation requirements
-Plotting Maps to convey proposed plans	QGIS + Excel
11	3:30 PM - 5:00 PM	Exercise: Substantiating a Budget Request with a Geospatial Plan	For a selected service PLN service territory in MMU or NTT, we will ask trainees to substantiate a budget request of $X Million be estimating CAPEX costs expected for connecting a certain number of households.  	QGIS + Excel
