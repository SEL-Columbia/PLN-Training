    Training for PLN Staff in a GIS-based Energy Planning approach
</p>
<p align="center">
    Prepared March 26, 2014
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Summary: </strong>
    The Earth Institute’s (EI) electricity planning work in Eastern Indonesia (Maluku, Maluku Utara and NTT) employed several techniques using national and PLN
    datasets via spreadsheets and data-manipulation programs, open-source and freely available GIS software as well as the EI’s web-tool
    &lt;networkplanner.org&gt;. The WorldBank consultants, EI and Castalia, working on the Indonesia Energy Access Scale up Project will present final results
    in Jakarta on Wednesday, March 26. Following this workshop, the EI team will offer trainings on the methodology and datasets used to derive such plans.
</p>
<p>
    We propose here a two-day intensive training to provide additional interactive exercises and insights into the methods employed by EI for the analysis. The
    intent is to share ways of organizing data and presenting it to other departments within and outside the trainees’ agency. The team intends for the
    training to immediately follow the March 26 workshop in two parts.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Part 1</strong>
        : Directed to PLN Pusat planners and <em>Engineering Services</em> department to understand (i) the development of a GIS layered database of
        demographics and (ii) subsequent proposed electrification plans, and the process for deriving and re-creating them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Part 2</strong>
        : Directed to PLN Wilayah staff and planning practitioners, Business and Technical Planning, to understand electrification plans and "adjust" the plan
        data and perform calculations on that data consistent with their RoadMap requirements to complement budgetary requests.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is highly recommended that PLN selects staff members for this training who have some familiarity or training with GIS tools (e.g. MapInfo, Google Earth,
    QGIS, JOSM or similar). They will be best prepared to establish and maintain a geospatial dataset. Each participant should bring a laptop with admin
    permissions in order to participate in training exercises.

    <strong>Overview</strong>
    :
</p>
<p align="left">
    The Earth Institute (EI) developed a digital, geo-spatially referenced demographic and MV line dataset as an input into its electricity planning model. The
    objective of this proposal is for EI to work with a core team of planners to provide a) sufficient technical support, in a local context, working
    side-by-side with PLN staff from both NTT and Ambon Wilayah offices and for the development of their annual Roadmaps plans and b) to provide an
    understanding of the proposed electrification plans, and the process for deriving, adjusting and re-creating them. This capacity building component biases
    on use of open-source software tools widely used for validation and editing of newly-acquired map data.
</p>
<p>
    We recommend the following staff and resources for this training:
</p>
<p>
    1) E.I. will provide:
</p>
<p>
    a. 3-4 researchers from the NYC team, for the workshop and subsequent two-day intensive training.
</p>
<p>
    b. Copies of free, open-source software for data collection, editing and analysis
</p>
<p>
    2) PLN is to provide:
</p>
<p>
    a. A meeting room to accommodate all trainees with a projector. Laptops/Desktops should be available for all participants as well as an internet connection
    as portions of the material are web based.
</p>
<p>
    b. 12-16 managerial, planning and technical-level PLN staff: 6-8 from the NTT Wilayah and Kupang Area offices, and another 6-8 from the Ambon Wilayah
    and/or Area offices, all committed for the full week visit.
</p>
<p>
    3) BPS and BIG are invited to attend training modules of interest to them, particularly with reference to forming a GIS demographic dataset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Proposed Outline:</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the interest of covering the breadth of analysis tools used within a short period of time, we are proposing condensing all major processes employed in
    the geospatial analysis into distinct modules. Each module will be designed to span about 1 hour and will encourage trainees to follow along to produce an
    exemplative<strong> </strong>output of a smaller subset of the project area. It will be impossible to train in depth on all the skills used but we thought
    it was best to touch upon all aspects used at least a little bit. Below are key topic to be covered in through the training modules:
</p>
<p>
    Day 1
</p>
<p>
    1. Introduction
</p>
<p>
    2. Forming a GIS demographic dataset of NTT &amp; MMU.
</p>
<p>
    3. Digitizing PLN Assets to form a consolidated, shareable dataset of the MV Network
</p>
<p>
    4. Using NetworkPlanner to envision an optimal planning-level proposed network
</p>
<p>
    5. Exporting, Understanding and visualizing NetworkPlanner results
</p>
<p>
    Day 2
</p>
<p>
    6. Sequencing a Connections on a Grid Rollout
</p>
<p>
    7. Summarizing the Plan, Evaluating Per Household Costs, Developing Phases and resulting Budget envelopes
</p>
<p>
    8. Understanding the PLN Roadmap Formulation
</p>
<p>
    9. Re-evaluate Updated Electrification Scenarios
</p>
<p>
    10.Useful Calculations in QGIS for Roadmap Process
</p>
<p>
    11.Exercise: Substantiating a Budget Request with a Geospatial Plan
</p>
<p>

<p>
    Below is a suggested use of the two-day allotment to cover modules that in parts are mutually exclusive but collectively exhaustive of the process.

                    The EI team incorporated the best available national datasets provided courtesy of BIG and BPS to form a comprehensive, collectively
                    exhaustive geo-referenced demographic dataset of project area in the Malukus and NTT. Here we will review (i) the merger of BPS &amp; BIG
                    data and sub-Desa level classification used and (ii) the use of BPS Desa level data in the absence of any settlement land use
                    classification. In this way, one composite view of Demographics was established quickly albeit coarsely.

                    In MMU and NTT, PLN has an excellent institutional knowledge of locations, types and quantity of MV line assets but in a bit of
distributed, disaggregated form. To better serve Pusat and Wilayah level planning, the EI team formed a central repository                    <a href="http://plngridmaps.modilabs.org/?lat=-4.92&amp;lon=126.28&amp;zoom=6&amp;layers=MG">&lt;plngridmaps.modilabs.org&gt;</a> to edit,
                    collaborate and host geo-located PLN assets essential for planning. Here we review the process involved in this development and ability to

                    In the PLN Roadmap process, it's helpful to understand metrics about village locations with regards to existing PLN assets and target
                    goals. Here we cover functionality in the free, well supported GIS package <em>QGIS</em>. Functions we will cover include how to:

                    - Sum the demand to get peak loads per region
                    <br/>
                    - Aggregate by sub-network and admin unit and/or island group

                    - Aggregate all of the above by phase
